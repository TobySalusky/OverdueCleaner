# OverdueCleaner
**Allows you to dismiss overdue assignments on Schoology**

> Does not currently work on strictly school-managed accounts/devices (namely **chrome books**) due to a lack of permissions.

# Usage

### Dismissing

Overdue assignments on `Schoology` will appear with an **`X`** button to their right.

Clicking this button will trigger a popup to confirm the assignment's dismissal. 

### Undismissing

If any assignments are dismissed, the count will be shown at the top of the `Overdue` section.

> ex. *"5 dismissed assignments..."*

Clicking this piece of text will trigger a popup listing all dismissed assigments.

If the name of an assignment is clicked here, it will be undismissed.

> **NOTE:** Currently, undismissed assignments ***will not*** reappear immediately. **For this, a `refresh` is required**.
